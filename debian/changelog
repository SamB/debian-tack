tack (1.07-1~mentors7) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Adopt package.
    Closes: #660140 (ITP for this package).
  * Switch to dpkg-source 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * New patch 02-manpage-hyphen-used-as-minus.patch.  Thanks, lintian, for
    the warning.
  * Re-add debian/watch file (was dropped in 1.06-3).
  * Enable build warnings.
  * Add Vcs-Browser: and Vcs-Git: fields to debian/control.
  * Install a symlink CHANGES.gz -> changelog.gz in the doc directory.
  * Update debian/copyright to final DEP5 format.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to regenerate the configure script during build
    + Build-depends on dh-autoreconf and autoconf-dickey.
    + This also takes care of pulling up-to-date config.guess and config.sub
      scripts in from autotools-dev.
    + ... except with autoconf-dickey it doesn't, so use autotools-dev's
      dh_ commands; bump build-depends to autotools-dev (>= 20100122.1)
      accordingly.  (Yes, even though it says "Do NOT" in the autotools-dev
      README.Debian.gz.)
  * Add support for dpkg-buildflags(1) by bumping debhelper compatibility
    level (and build-depends) to 9.
    + Drop the LDFLAGS="-Wl,-z,defs,-ltic from the call to
      dh_auto_configure, so that configure will pick up the LDFLAGS from
      dpkg-buildflags(1).
    + Replace it with:
      - LIBS="-ltic" as an argument to dh_auto_configure
      - DEB_LDFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND for the rest.
        Build-Depends: dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.1).
  * New patch 03-allow-echoing-compilation-commands.patch, which enables
    printing of compilation commands by default.
  * Update package to Standards-Version: 3.9.3.
  * Thanks to Jakub Wilk for his thorough review.
